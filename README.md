## Mission

ChaseWhiteRabbit is an NGO that transforms grief into systemic change through sustainable technology solutions. We create income-producing applications that address root causes of social problems, with our flagship project **GriefToDesign** leading this revolution. Our core belief is that **automation is compassion at scale** - we build tools that both generate sustainable revenue and create lasting social impact.

### Our Values

- **Big-Heart Efficiency**: Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around
- **Radical Transparency**: We open-source everything possible and operate with full transparency
- **Prevention Over Punishment**: We design systems that address root causes, not just symptoms
- **Bandwidth Empathy**: Our solutions work for everyone, regardless of their device or connection speed
- **Learning in Public**: We share our wins and missteps so others can learn and grow

## Flagship Project: GriefToDesign

**Repository**: [github.com/tiation/grieftodesign](https://github.com/tiation/grieftodesign)

GriefToDesign transforms personal trauma into actionable systemic solutions. Born from the devastating loss of a child, this platform provides a framework for anyone to convert their grief into policy recommendations, system redesigns, and preventive measures.

### The $19 Trillion Solution
Our research demonstrates that Australia's $19 trillion in national wealth could eliminate scarcity and prevent many tragedies. The GriefToDesign platform includes:
- Mathematical proof of wealth redistribution feasibility
- 12 Acts for complete systemic transformation
- Trust-first governance models
- Implementation roadmaps for abundance-based society

### Revenue Model
- **Free Tier**: Basic grief-to-design tools for personal healing
- **Professional Tier**: Advanced analytics for therapists and counselors ($29/month)
- **Organization Tier**: Bulk licensing for NGOs and government agencies ($199/month)
- **Consultation Services**: Custom systemic analysis projects ($2,000-$50,000)
