# ChaseWhiteRabbit Code of Conduct

## Our Cooperative Pledge

At ChaseWhiteRabbit, we are committed to building a community and workplace culture rooted in **cooperation rather than competition**. Research has consistently shown that cooperative environments yield better results across metrics that matter: productivity, creativity, job satisfaction, and even physical and mental health.

We pledge to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique skills and perspectives without fear of censure or competitive pressure.

## Why Cooperation?

Scientific research dating back to the late 1800s has consistently demonstrated that cooperation outperforms competition in virtually every meaningful metric:

- Scientists who consider themselves cooperative tend to publish more articles
- Cooperative businesspeople earn higher salaries
- Cooperative students achieve higher grade point averages
- Cooperative teams report higher job satisfaction and lower turnover
- Cooperation significantly increases creativity and innovation
- Cooperative environments promote better psychological and physical health

As Dr. Perry W. Buffington notes, "If competition brings out the 'beast' in us, then cooperation surely brings out the 'best' in us."

## Our Standards

To create and maintain our cooperative culture, we expect all members of the ChaseWhiteRabbit community to:

### 1. Practice Reciprocity
- Actively look for ways to help others succeed
- Express gratitude when receiving help
- Offer assistance before it's requested
- Create a cycle of positive interactions

### 2. Share Leadership
- Support distributed leadership models
- Recognize that leadership can and should come from anywhere in the organization
- Foster a sense of ownership among all team members
- Create space for others to take initiative

### 3. Focus on Collective Success
- Measure success by the team's outcomes, not individual achievements
- Celebrate team wins with equal recognition for all contributors
- Frame challenges as opportunities for collective problem-solving
- Reject zero-sum thinking (the belief that for someone to win, another must lose)

### 4. Share Resources and Information
- Default to transparency in sharing knowledge
- Make documentation and learning resources accessible to all
- Avoid information hoarding or gatekeeping
- Support new team members with comprehensive onboarding

### 5. Maintain Respectful Communication
- Use inclusive language
- Listen actively and engage thoughtfully
- Ask questions using similar language to establish rapport
- Provide constructive feedback that helps others grow

### 6. Prioritize Well-being
- Respect work-life boundaries
- Allow ample time for complex collaborative work
- Recognize the health benefits of cooperative environments
- Check in regularly on team members' well-being

## Balanced Cooperation

While we champion cooperation, we also recognize the importance of maintaining independent critical thinking. As Scott G. Isaksen notes, cooperation must be balanced with objectivity to avoid "group-think" or inappropriate conformity.

We encourage:
- Respectful challenging of ideas (not people)
- Devil's advocate perspectives when carefully framed
- Diversity of thought and approach
- Constructive disagreement that leads to better solutions

## Enforcement and Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that contradicts this code of conduct:

1. **Document the incident**: Note what happened, when, and who was involved
2. **Report the concern**: Contact conduct@chasewhiterabbit.org or speak with a team leader
3. **Collaborative resolution**: We will work with all parties to find cooperative solutions

Serious or repeated violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the community.
